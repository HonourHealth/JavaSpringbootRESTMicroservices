# **Microservices Architecture with Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, and Eureka**
## **Overview**
This project is a **microservices-based architecture** that consists of multiple services, each with a clearly defined responsibility. It takes full advantage of **Spring Cloud**, **Eureka**, **Resilience4j**, and **Spring Cloud Gateway** for routing and scaling.
The architecture includes the following services:

- **Service Registry**: Eureka Server for service discovery.
- **Department Service**: A service to manage departments.
- **Employee Service**: A service to manage employees, integrated with Department and Organization services.
- **Organization Service**: A service to manage organizations.
- **API Gateway**: A gateway to route requests to appropriate microservices.
- **Config Server**: A centralized configuration server.

The architecture demonstrates:
- Service-to-service communication using Feign clients.
- Circuit breaker and retry mechanisms using Resilience4j.
- Externalized configuration and dynamic refresh using Spring Cloud Config with Spring Cloud Bus and RabbitMQ.
- Service discovery using Eureka.
- API Gateway request routing.
- Tracing and monitoring using Micrometer and Zipkin.
- Persistence with Spring Data JPA and MySQL.

## **Service-to-Service Communication**
The communication between services is facilitated using **OpenFeign**, which simplifies RESTful web service invocation. For example:
### Fetching Department Details in Employee Service:
``` java
@FeignClient(name = "DEPARTMENT-SERVICE")
public interface APIClientDepService {
    @GetMapping("api/departments/{department-code}")
    DepartmentDto getDepartment(@PathVariable("department-code") String departmentCode);
}
```
### Fetching Organization Details in Employee Service:
``` java
@FeignClient(name = "ORGANIZATION-SERVICE")
public interface APIClientOrgService {
    @GetMapping("api/organizations/{organization_code}")
    OrganizationDto getOrganization(@PathVariable("organization_code") String organizationCode);
}
```
These Feign clients simplify and standardize inter-service communication while leveraging **Eureka** for dynamic service discovery.

## **Dynamic Configuration with RabbitMQ**
The project uses **Spring Cloud Bus** with **RabbitMQ** to propagate dynamic configuration changes from the **Config Server** to all microservices without manual restarts.
- **Steps**:
    1. Config Server pushes changes to RabbitMQ when values in its linked Git repository are updated.
    2. RabbitMQ broadcasts these updates to all services listening on the Spring Cloud Bus.
    3. The microservices automatically refresh their context without requiring a restart.

#### **RabbitMQ Docker Setup**:
``` bash
docker run --rm -it -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:4.0.5
```

## **Resilience4j Integration**
The project uses Resilience4j for circuit breaker and retry functionality in service-to-service calls. Hereâ€™s an example implementation in the **EmployeeServiceImpl** class:
### Retry Mechanism:
``` java
@Retry(name = "${spring.application.name}", fallbackMethod = "getDefaultDepartment")
public APIResponseDto getEmployeeById(Long employeeId) {
    LOGGER.info("Fetching employee details with retry...");
    // Logic for fetching employee, department, and organization details
}
```
### Fallback Method for Circuit Breaker:
``` java
public APIResponseDto getDefaultDepartment(Long employeeId, Exception exception) {
    LOGGER.info("Fallback method invoked due to an error...");
    // Returning default department data
    DepartmentDto departmentDto = new DepartmentDto("Fallback Dept", "Default Dept Desc", "DEFAULT");
    // Construct APIResponseDto with fallback data
    return new APIResponseDto(employeeDto, departmentDto);
}
```
The retry and fallback configurations are defined in `application.properties` of the employee-service

## **Central Configuration with Config Server**
All services retrieve their configuration from a centralized Git repository configured in the Config Server. The repository URI is defined in the **application.properties** of the Config Server:
``` properties
spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=https://github.com/HonourHealth/config-server-repo
spring.cloud.config.server.git.default-label=main
```
Services use the following line to fetch configuration from the Config Server:
``` properties
spring.config.import=optional:configserver:http://localhost:8888
```
This allows for externalizing configurations, making it easier to manage environments like `dev`, `qa`, and `prod`.
## **Service Discovery with Eureka**
- The **Service Registry** is implemented using Eureka.
- All services (Employee, Department, Organization, Config Server, API Gateway) register themselves with Eureka using the following configuration:
``` properties
eureka.client.serviceUrl.defaultZone=http://localhost:8761/eureka/
eureka.instance.prefer-ip-address=true
```
Eureka helps in dynamic service discovery and load balancing.
## **API Gateway Configuration**
The **API Gateway** routes requests to respective microservices using predefined paths. Example configurations for routing:
``` properties
### Employee Service Route ###
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].id=EMPLOYEE-SERVICE
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].uri=lb://EMPLOYEE-SERVICE
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[0].predicates[0]=Path=/api/employees/**
```
``` properties
### Routes for Department Service ###
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[1].id=DEPARTMENT-SERVICE
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[1].uri=lb://DEPARTMENT-SERVICE
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[1].predicates[0]=Path=/api/departments/**
```
``` properties
### Routes for Organization Service ###
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[2].id=ORGANIZATION-SERVICE
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[2].uri=lb://ORGANIZATION-SERVICE
spring.cloud.gateway.routes[2].predicates[0]=Path=/api/organizations/**
```
The API Gateway also enables CORS configurations globally:
``` properties
spring.cloud.gateway.globalcors.corsConfigurations.[/**].allowedOrigins=*
spring.cloud.gateway.globalcors.corsConfigurations.[/**].allowedMethods=GET,POST,PUT,DELETE
```
